# Visualization Studio Development Kit

In order to make the Visualization Studio more accessible to the faculty, students, and staff at NC State, this course has been created to explain how to use the Visualization Studio with the Unity Engine. The course covers a wide array of topics, from working with the space in 2D and 3D as well as working with a custom emulator that can be used within the Unity Engine. We hope you enjoy the course.
